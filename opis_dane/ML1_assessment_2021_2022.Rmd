# General information

In teams of **at most 2 persons students** will work on two practical machine learning projects -- one for **regression** and one for **classification**. Please inform the lecturer about the team members by email [anowicki@wne.uw.edu.pl](mailto:anowicki@wne.uw.edu.pl) **the latest by midnight <span style="color:red">2022-04-20</span>**.

# Datasets

The data is **exactly the same for all teams**.

## `traffic` for **regression**

# Various algorithms

For each of the datasets please consider and compare **at least 3 different ML algorithms discussed in the ML1 course**. You can also apply **in addition** any other algorithms you know, but their use should be clearly justified in the final report.

# Selection of the best algorithm

The choice of the final algorithm applied to generate predictions should be **clearly explained** in the final report.

> HINT !!!!!
> Use the internal division of the training data into train/validation/test samples to make sure that you correcly assess the performance of your models on the new data.

# Performance measure

The performance of predictions will be based on:

1. `MAPE` for the **traffic** dataset
2. `balanced accuracy` for the **drugs** dataset

Please report the **expected** value of a particular performance measure in your presentation and final report.

# Points

In total **100 points** can be collected -- 50 for each project:

* **presentation** in class (**10 pts** for each project)
* **written report** in **RMarkdown** or **jupyter** (**30 pts** for each project)
* **out-of-sample** performance (**10 pts** for each project):
    * `10` if predictive performance in top quartile group (best), 
    * `7.5` if predictive performance in the 2nd quartile group (good),
    * `5` if predictive performance in the 3rd quartile group (below average),
    * `2.5` if predictive performance in the 4th quartile group (unlucky),

# Presentations

The **presentation** prepared in **RMarkdown** or in **jupyter** has to be submitted by email to the lecturer [anowicki@wne.uw.edu.pl](mailto:anowicki@wne.uw.edu.pl) **until midnight eod <span style="color:red">2022-06-03</span>** (presentation should be submitted both as the source `*.Rmd`/`*.ipynb` file **and also** in the version compiled to `html` or `pdf` format). The codes included in the `Rmd`/`ipynb` file should **load the training data**, **train** the single best algorithm, **apply** this model on the **test data** and save predictions in the `csv` file, which **should be also attached**.

> Do NOT include all the codes which you applied for the best algorithm selection, parameter search, etc. ONLY a simple code for a FINALLY selected algorithm i.e. with the selected set of best performing parameters for each dataset. 

All teams will give presentations (**10 minutes**) informing about the algorithms considered, selection process and their **expected results**. 

Presentations will take place on <span style="color:red">2022-06-07</span>.

> Groups that do NOT present their results in class **will not be graded**. 

# Final report

The **final written report** should be submitted together with the presentation by midnight eod <span style="color:red">2022-06-03</span> (report should be submitted both as the source `*.Rmd`/`*.ipynb` file **and also** in the version compiled to `docx` format). It should include a **detailed explanation** of the finally selected strategy **for each dataset** (algorithms considered, data transformations applied, steps of model selection, hyperparameter values considered, etc.). The assessment of **expected performance of the test data predictions** should also be reported.

> Students who do not submit their final report **before the deadline** will not be graded and will not be allowed to **take the final written exam** in summer session.

# Important dates again

* <span style="color:red">2022-04-20</span> by end of day -- submission of information about the **team members** 
* <span style="color:red">2022-06-03</span> by 23:59 -- submission of **presentations** and **final reports** in R Markdown **with working R codes** behind,
* <span style="color:red">2022-06-07</span> -- in-class **presentations**

Each submission should be done **via email** to [anowicki@wne.uw.edu.pl](mailto:anowicki@wne.uw.edu.pl) **before midnight** of the deadline day **if not stated otherwise**.
